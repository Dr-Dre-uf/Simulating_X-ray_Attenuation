X-rays pass through the body and are absorbed (or attenuated) by different tissues depending on their density and atomic number. The amount of attenuation determines how bright or dark a region appears on the X-ray image.

High attenuation materials (e.g., bone with high calcium content) absorb more X-rays and allow fewer to reach the detector. They appear brighter (white) on the X-ray image.

Low attenuation materials (e.g., air in lungs) allow most X-rays to pass through - they appear darker (black) on the X-ray image.

Intermediate tissues like muscle, fat, or organs absorb X-rays to a moderate degree. They appear in shades of gray.

**Biological Interpretation:**

*   Bones show up as bright white because theyâ€™re dense and highly attenuate X-rays.
*   Lungs are mostly air-filled, appearing dark, which helps radiologists detect infiltrates or fluid buildup.
*   Soft tissues such as liver, heart, or muscles appear in various gray levels based on their composition and density.
